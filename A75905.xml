            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Firſt, that I might portray and ſet forth the true and lively Image of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of all other Cities the moſt glorious and famous throughout the whole world, whereof mention is made in ſacred and in prophane hiſtories, as it flouriſhed in Chriſt his time; and alſo the forme of the Temple (the fame whereof hath been extolled above the heavens, and was worthy of eternal me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory) by the ſacred Scriptures, by approved Writers, and by ancient tradition of faithful and truſty men, in a lively plot, or Map, moſt exquiſitly drawn, together with the names, originals, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, that I might rightly diſpoſe the places of Chriſt his Paſſion, and repreſent every thing which he ſuffered in every place, even as if they were now done before our eyes, and ſo repreſented, that I might explain it with plainneſs and brevity. For hereby all thoſe things which he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:152791:4"/>for our ſakes, will be both more plainly underſtood, and alſo more profitably remembred. But peradventure there will be ſome which will miſlike this our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and the rather becauſe we have many things by tradition of Elders; to whom I anſwer out of <hi>Hierom,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>That Eccleſiaſtical traditions, which are no hindrance to faith, are ſo to be kept, as they were delivered by the Ancients.</hi> In the mean time I will not ſay, that they are too raſh, and too too wicked, which will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that thing,<note place="margin">Hier.

So many of us therefore as are waſhed with the bloud of Chriſt, doe bear his name, and are called Chriſtians, if our faith the anſwering to our name, and our life, not diſagreeing from the truth, hoping to be ſaved by the merits and grace of Chriſt our Saviour, let us beleeve that, which incorrupt and reverend Antiquity hath left, let us in no wiſe depart from thoſe things [which our <hi>Anceſtors</hi> have celebrated without any ſuperſtition, &amp;] w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> by the conſent of the whole world, are come even from them to our hands, and with thankfull godlineſſe, and godly thankfulneſs, let us call to minde thoſe places oftentimes, which may put us in remembrance of the Paſſion of Chriſt; to which places this Map will lead us, as it were by the hand; and with the eyes of faith, and of our minde, let us look upon the ſame Sonne of God, and inwardly behold him, who being urged with the great love of our ſalvation, having finiſhed his laſt Supper in the Parlour of <hi>Sion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">[The ſumme of Chriſts Paſſion.]</note> and being come into the Garden of Olivet, prayed and ſwet blood, through the anguiſh and grievous conſideration of the immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent afflictions. Immediately he was betrayed by the moſt wicked <hi>Judas;</hi> he was taken, bound, and thruſt
<pb facs="tcp:152791:4"/>forward by the <hi>Jews,</hi> even as a Lamb by the Wolves, moſt cruelly amidſt the noiſe of clamors and weapons, and then was lead to the houſe of <hi>Anna</hi> the high Prieſt; There he was ſtricken; from thence hee was drawn to the Pallace of <hi>Caiphas;</hi> in the ſame hee was falſely accuſed, condemned, ſpit upon, blindfolded, buffeted with fiſts, and ſundry wayes all the night ſcorned and afflicted. In the morning he was violently carried through the midſt of the City to the houſe of <hi>Pilate.</hi> From thence he was lead to the Pallace of <hi>Herod,</hi> and accuſed again, deſpiſed of him, mocked, and apparrelled like a fool in a white garment, and brought back again by another way of the City to <hi>Pilate.</hi> There again he was accuſed of many faults, ſtripped, and grievouſly whipped, cloathed with purple, crowned with thorns, diverſly derided, ſpit upon, buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted with fiſts, and ſtricken with a reed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus miſuſed, was made a gazing ſtock to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and adjudged to death. Then he was loaden with a heavy Croſſe, and in the ſight of all the people, with grievous and bloody ſteps he was drawn, punched, and urged by the furious violence of the ſouldiers, through a great part of the City, and by the gate of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of the City, by a hard and ſtony way, even unto mount <hi>Calvary.</hi> And being come thither he was ſtripped again, and being both faint and weary, was refreſhed with gall inſtead of drinke; and about high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon he was faſtened to the Croſſe, and ſo lifted up on high; and hanging on the croſſe by the ſpace of three hours, was derided with taunts and reproachful words; being thirſty, they gave him vineger to drink. Finally, he which could ſave the world with one drop of his blood, would needs beſtow upon us by the five rivers
<pb facs="tcp:152791:5"/>of his wounds, his life, with all his blood. A figure hereof was that Brazen-ſerpent,<note place="margin">Num. 21.3.

            <head>The Reaſons why ſome Traditions of Reliques are forborn in the Tranſlation; and why ſome are publiſhed.</head>
            <p>IT is to be granted, that this <hi>Breidenbach, Brocard, Paſch, Saligniac,</hi> (as alſo <hi>Tyren</hi>) were <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and that they deſired the promoting of their Religion; a great part whereof, is, in viſiting of Saints <hi>Reliques;</hi> and they received from their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors many <hi>Traditions,</hi> which they reſpect and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold as much, as, yea, more then the <hi>Word of God</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Hence ſeveral ſuch <hi>Paſſages</hi> that were in the <hi>Latin,</hi> are left out by the <hi>Tranſlator;</hi> as that of <hi>Veronica</hi>'s Neckerchere,<note n="†" place="margin">Or Section 42. of the Book.</note> 
               <hi>Numb.</hi> 42 and of <hi>Pelagia</hi>'s Houſe: So alſo this about <hi>Helen's finding the Croſs, by the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſmell or odor of the Spices and Oyntments, which the Earth ſent forth: By which miracle, that venerable
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152791:10"/>Empreſs was confirmed,</hi> ſay thoſe Popiſh Authors (in <hi>Number</hi> 240.) Which argues. That the Women an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed Chriſts Body with that precious Ointment or Odors upon the Croſs: <hi>For that anointing of Chriſts feet, was ſix or ſeven days before Chriſts death,</hi> Joh. 12.1, 2. Whereas the <hi>Scriptures</hi> ſhew moſt plainly, That the Women bought not thoſe Spices for Ointments and Odors to Chriſts Body, until Chriſt was taken from the Croſs, and buried: Which Odors they brought, not to the empty Croſs, but to the Garden where Chriſt was buried, ſome way diſtant from the Croſs; and there they would have anointed him, but did not, becauſe Chriſt was riſen before they came, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.53, 56. <hi>&amp;</hi> 24.1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.57. <hi>&amp;</hi> 28.1, 2. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.1, 2, 6.</p>
            <p>Hence the <hi>Tranſlator</hi> forbears this, and divers of ſuch vain <hi>Traditions,</hi> as tend to make the Word of God of none effect (<hi>Matth.</hi> 15.6, 9.) ſome of them remain, that the <hi>Reader</hi> may know, in what place the <hi>Relick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers</hi> will ſhew ſuch and ſuch things, which never were there; as the <hi>Note</hi> added from <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> makes evident.

And for this cauſe, God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lie; that they all might be damned, who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> I could name one whom I knew, noted for miſerable cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, when in ſickneſs he prevailed not to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by a <hi>Minister,</hi> was prevailed with by a <hi>Priest</hi>
